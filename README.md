# Project

Android chating app with both group chat and 1-1 chat

## Getting Started

The softwares which we use to run android applications on windows or on any other platforms are known as Emulator.

Although Bluestack or other similar applications are simple to use to run android applications but it require sufficient RAM to run smoothly.

OPEN AN APK FILE ON WINDOWS
You can open an APK file on a PC using an Android emulator like BlueStacks. In that program, go into the My Apps tab and then choose Install apk from the corner of the window.

How to Use Bluestacks to Run Android Apps on Windows 
OPEN AN APK FILE ON A MAC
ARC Welder is a Google Chrome extension that's meant for testing Android apps for the Chrome OS, but it works on any OS. This means you can open an APK on your Mac or Windows computer so long as you have this app installed within the Chrome browser.

OPEN AN APK FILE ON IOS
You can't open or install APK files on an iPhone or iPad because the file is built in an entirely different manner than apps used on those devices, and the two platforms aren't compatible with each other.

EXTRACTING APK FILES
You can also open an APK file in Windows, macOS, or any other desktop operating system, with a file extractor tool. Since APK files are simply archives of multiple folders and files, you can unzip them with a program like 7-Zip or PeaZip to see the different components that make up the app.
